# abapPGP
ABAP implementation of OpenPGP

# Requirements
https://github.com/Sumu-Ning/AES

# Work in progresss

Current scope is signing, see https://github.com/larshp/abapGit/issues/358

# Warning

It is stupid to write your own encryption/PGP library, abapPGP will most certainly contain severe bugs.

Do not use this for anything important, instead use real PGP software like [openPGP](http://openpgp.org/)
